# Personalized Content Storage Implementation

## Overview
This improvement changes the email campaign system from generating personalized content on-the-fly in the history display to storing the actual sent content in the database when emails are sent.

## Benefits

### 1. **Data Integrity**
- **Before**: History showed reconstructed content that might not match what was actually sent
- **After**: History shows the exact content that was sent to each recipient

### 2. **Performance**
- **Before**: Runtime template processing with JOIN queries to contacts table for each history view
- **After**: Direct retrieval of stored content with simple queries

### 3. **Reliability**
- **Before**: If contact information changed, history would show incorrect "personalized" content
- **After**: Content is preserved as it was when the email was sent

### 4. **Debugging**
- **Before**: Difficult to verify what was actually sent vs. what should have been sent
- **After**: Exact sent content is available for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Added to email_campaign_history table:
ALTER TABLE email_campaign_history ADD COLUMN personalized_subject TEXT;
ALTER TABLE email_campaign_history ADD COLUMN personalized_body TEXT;
```

### Email Sending Process
```python
# Before sending email:
personalized_subject = subject.replace("{{name}}", cname).replace("{{email}}", cemail).replace("{{mobile}}", cmobile)
personalized_body = body.replace("{{name}}", cname).replace("{{email}}", cemail).replace("{{mobile}}", cmobile)

# Send email with personalized content
send_email_with_connection_check(method, settings, sender, password, cemail, personalized_subject, personalized_body, sender_name)

# Store the actual sent content in database
INSERT INTO email_campaign_history 
(campaign_id, contact_id, timestamp, status, error, personalized_subject, personalized_body) 
VALUES (?, ?, datetime('now'), ?, '', ?, ?)
```

### History Display
```python
# Simple query using stored content:
SELECT h.timestamp, ct.email, c.name, 
       COALESCE(h.personalized_body, c.body) as body_content, 
       h.status 
FROM email_campaign_history h
LEFT JOIN email_campaigns c ON h.campaign_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN contacts ct ON h.contact_id = ct.id
```

### Backward Compatibility
The `COALESCE(h.personalized_body, c.body)` ensures:
- **New records**: Show actual personalized content from `h.personalized_body`
- **Old records**: Fall back to campaign template from `c.body`

## Migration
- Existing records: Continue to show template content (with placeholders)
- New records: Will show the actual personalized content sent
- No data loss or breaking changes

## Future Benefits
- Email audit trails for compliance
- A/B testing capability (can compare what was actually sent)
- Better customer support (know exactly what each customer received)
- Debugging email delivery issues
