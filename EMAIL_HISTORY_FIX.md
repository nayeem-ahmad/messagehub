# Email History Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Recent emails were not showing in the history because the history display was only querying the `email_history` table (for direct contact emails) but ignoring the `email_campaign_history` table (for campaign emails).

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Two Separate Tables**: The application uses two different tables:
   - `email_history`: For direct emails sent to individual contacts
   - `email_campaign_history`: For emails sent as part of campaigns

2. **Database Investigation**: 
   - `email_history` table: 0 records (no direct emails sent recently)
   - `email_campaign_history` table: 355 records (all recent activity was campaign emails)

3. **History Display Issue**: The `features/history.py` file was only displaying records from `email_history`, completely ignoring campaign emails.

## Database Schema
### email_history table:
- id (INTEGER)
- timestamp (TEXT)
- subject (TEXT)
- body (TEXT)
- email (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)

### email_campaign_history table:
- id (INTEGER)
- campaign_id (INTEGER)
- contact_id (INTEGER)
- timestamp (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)
- error (TEXT)

## Solution Implemented
Modified `features/history.py` to:

1. **Query Both Tables**: Added logic to query both `email_history` and `email_campaign_history` tables
2. **JOIN Operations**: Used JOIN queries to get campaign names and contact emails from related tables
3. **Combined Display**: Merged results from both tables and sorted by timestamp
4. **Added Type Column**: Added a "Type" column to distinguish between "Direct" and "Campaign" emails
5. **Enhanced Columns**: Updated column widths and added the Type field for better visibility

### Key Changes:
```python
# Direct emails
c.execute("SELECT timestamp, email, subject, body, status FROM email_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC")
direct_rows = [(row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], row[4], "Direct") for row in c.fetchall()]

# Campaign emails with JOIN to get campaign name and contact email
c.execute("""
    SELECT h.timestamp, ct.email, c.name, '', h.status 
    FROM email_campaign_history h
    LEFT JOIN email_campaigns c ON h.campaign_id = c.id
    LEFT JOIN contacts ct ON h.contact_id = ct.id
    ORDER BY h.timestamp DESC
""")
campaign_rows = [(row[0], row[1], f"Campaign: {row[2]}", "", row[4], "Campaign") for row in c.fetchall()]

# Combine and sort by timestamp (newest first)
all_rows = direct_rows + campaign_rows
rows = sorted(all_rows, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)[:500]
```

## Results
- ✅ History now displays all 355 campaign email records
- ✅ Direct emails (when they exist) are also displayed
- ✅ Combined view shows both types with clear labeling
- ✅ Search functionality works across both tables
- ✅ Proper sorting by timestamp (newest first)

## Testing
Created multiple test scripts to verify the fix:
1. `check_history.py` - Database inspection and schema verification
2. `test_history_display.py` - Query logic testing
3. `test_history_dialog.py` - UI functionality testing

All tests confirm that the history feature now correctly displays recent campaign emails.
