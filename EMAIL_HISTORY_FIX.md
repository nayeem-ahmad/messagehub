# Email History Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Recent emails were not showing in the history because the history display was only querying the `email_history` table (for direct contact emails) but ignoring the `email_campaign_history` table (for campaign emails). Additionally, the Body column was showing template placeholders instead of the actual personalized content sent to recipients.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Two Separate Tables**: The application uses two different tables:
   - `email_history`: For direct emails sent to individual contacts
   - `email_campaign_history`: For emails sent as part of campaigns

2. **Database Investigation**: 
   - `email_history` table: 0 records (no direct emails sent recently)
   - `email_campaign_history` table: 355 records (all recent activity was campaign emails)

3. **History Display Issues**: 
   - The `features/history.py` file was only displaying records from `email_history`
   - Campaign email body content was showing template placeholders ({{name}}) instead of actual sent content

4. **Template vs. Actual Content**: Campaign emails are stored as templates, but personalized content was not being preserved after sending

## Database Schema Enhancement
### Original email_campaign_history table:
- id (INTEGER)
- campaign_id (INTEGER)
- contact_id (INTEGER)
- timestamp (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)
- error (TEXT)

### Enhanced email_campaign_history table:
- id (INTEGER)
- campaign_id (INTEGER)
- contact_id (INTEGER)
- timestamp (TEXT)
- status (TEXT)
- error (TEXT)
- **personalized_subject (TEXT)** ← NEW
- **personalized_body (TEXT)** ← NEW

## Solution Implemented
Modified both the database schema and application logic to:

1. **Database Migration**: Added `personalized_subject` and `personalized_body` columns to `email_campaign_history`
2. **Enhanced Email Sending**: Modified campaign email sending to store the actual personalized content
3. **Simplified History Display**: Updated history queries to use stored personalized content directly
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Used `COALESCE()` to fall back to template content for old records

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Database Migration (migrate_campaign_history.py):
```sql
ALTER TABLE email_campaign_history ADD COLUMN personalized_subject TEXT;
ALTER TABLE email_campaign_history ADD COLUMN personalized_body TEXT;
```

#### 2. Enhanced Email Sending (features/email.py):
```python
# Store personalized content when email is sent successfully
c_th.execute(
    "INSERT INTO email_campaign_history (campaign_id, contact_id, timestamp, status, error, personalized_subject, personalized_body) VALUES (?, ?, datetime('now'), ?, '', ?, ?)",
    (campaign_id, cid, 'Sent', personalized_subject, personalized_body)
)
```

#### 3. Simplified History Display (features/history.py):
```python
# Use stored personalized content, fall back to template for old records
c.execute("""
    SELECT h.timestamp, ct.email, c.name, 
           COALESCE(h.personalized_body, c.body) as body_content, 
           h.status 
    FROM email_campaign_history h
    LEFT JOIN email_campaigns c ON h.campaign_id = c.id
    LEFT JOIN contacts ct ON h.contact_id = ct.id
    ORDER BY h.timestamp DESC
""")
```

## Results
- ✅ History now displays all 355 campaign email records
- ✅ Direct emails (when they exist) are also displayed
- ✅ Combined view shows both types with clear labeling
- ✅ Search functionality works across both tables
- ✅ Proper sorting by timestamp (newest first)
- ✅ Body column displays campaign email content
- ✅ Improved column widths for better readability
- ✅ **New emails store actual personalized content** (not templates)
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Old records show template, new records show actual sent content
- ✅ **Performance improvement**: No runtime template processing needed for history display
- ✅ **Data integrity**: Exact content sent to each recipient is preserved

## Testing
Created multiple test scripts to verify the fix:
1. `migrate_campaign_history.py` - Database schema migration
2. `test_personalized_storage.py` - Verify personalized content storage
3. `check_history.py` - Database inspection and schema verification
4. `test_history_display.py` - Query logic testing
5. `test_history_dialog.py` - UI functionality testing

All tests confirm that:
- Database migration completed successfully
- New emails will store personalized content
- History feature displays both old (template) and new (personalized) content correctly
- UI functions without errors
